Attaching our packages and reading in data
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
library(skimr) #install.packages("skimr")
library(kableExtra) #install.packages ("kableExtra")
# read in lobster data
lobsters <- read_xlsx(here("data", "lobsters.xlsx"),
                      skip = 4)

```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Viewing our data with skimr
```{r}
skimr::skim(lobsters) # or skim(lobsters)

```

#Pivot Tables
In R, Pivot tables are: `group_by() %>% summarize()`
`n()` function will count observations


```{r}
#Group by year
lobsters %>% #control +shift
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year = n())
#Group by year and site
lobsters %>% #control +shift
  group_by(year, site) %>%
  summarize(count_by_year_site = n())

#Group by  site and year
lobsters %>% #control +shift
  group_by(site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_site_year = n())
```


Summarize by multiple variables and assign as an object
```{r}
siteyear_summary <- lobsters %>%
  group_by (site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_site_year = n(),
            mean_size_mm = mean(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_size_mm = sd(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) # allows r to calculate mean with missing values
```
            
Table formatting with `kableExtra::kable()`
```{r}
siteyear_summary %>%
  kable()
```
## Activity
1. build from our analyses: calculate the median lobster size for each site and year (hint:`size_mm` and a function called `median()`
2. create a ggplot and save
3. sync this to github

```{r}
siteyear_median <- lobsters %>%
  group_by (site, year) %>%
  summarize(count_by_site_year = n(),
            median_size_mm = median(size_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
            )
ggplot(data = siteyear_median, aes(x =year, y = median_size_mm, color =site)) +
  geom_line()
ggsave(here("figures", "lobsters-plot.png"))
```
